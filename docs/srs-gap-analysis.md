# Wathb SRS v1.1 — Gap Analysis

Status of the codebase (`SolutionsBy30/wathb_new`, branch `claude/ui-language-recommendation-oawn6q`) against `docs/wathb-srs.md`. Legend: ✅ Done · 🟡 Partial · ❌ Missing.

## §3.1 Public site, signup & onboarding (ONB)

| Req | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ONB-001/002/003 | ✅ | `src/pages/Landing` |
| ONB-004 self-service signup, both roles | ✅ | `auth/signup/student\|supervisor` |
| ONB-005 OTP by mobile | ✅ | 4-digit, `+966` prefix |
| ONB-006 package selection if no active sub | ✅ | `WathbService.today()` gate → Pricing screen |
| ONB-007 Paymob card/Mada | ✅ | `PaymobProvider`, untested against a live account |
| ONB-008 wire transfer + manual admin activation | ✅ | `activate-wire-transfer` |
| ONB-009 WhatsApp opt-in consent artifact | ✅ | Explicit checkbox on both student and supervisor signup forms; `@Equals(true)` on `whatsappOptIn` rejects unchecked/omitted at the DTO layer before the request reaches account creation; `User.whatsappOptInAt` is stamped with the consent timestamp. Admin-created accounts (no self-service consent step) correctly leave it null |
| ONB-010 goal capture (target test/date/score) | 🟡 | `GoalSetupDto` has these fields; UI only collects test + track today, not score/date at onboarding (score is set nowhere yet) |
| ONB-011 school picker w/ suggest-and-review | ✅ | Built this session — `geography/schools/suggest` |
| ONB-012 notification-window slot picker at onboarding | 🟡 | Fields exist (`notifSlotStartHour/EndHour`), settable from Profile post-onboarding, not during onboarding itself; no free-tier hide logic (free tier doesn't exist yet) |
| ONB-013 placement Wathb + optional supervisor invite prompt | 🟡 | Placement Wathb exists (`generatePlacement`); no post-signup "invite a supervisor?" prompt |
| ONB-014 OTP fallback `1928`, audited, disabled once WhatsApp live | 🟡 | Fallback built and correct; **not** written to any audit log (no audit_log table exists yet); no deploy-time check preventing it in production |

## §3.2–3.3 Student loop & dashboard (STU)

| Req | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| STU-001 streak/totals/composite index | 🟡 | Streak + totals ✅; **no composite index anywhere** — only a weekly delta calculation (`compositeDelta`), not a displayed headline number |
| STU-002 test picker among activated tests | 🟡 | Single `targetTestId` per student, not a multi-test "activated tests" set — no picker |
| STU-003/004/005/006 timed question UI, no back/skip | ✅ | `Question.jsx`, server-authoritative via `WathbQuestion.servedAt` |
| STU-007 **no repeat within a bundle** | 🟡 | Selection engine excludes previously-answered questions bundle-to-bundle, but has no explicit in-bundle distinctness guarantee independent of that — needs verification/test |
| STU-008 **single-section-per-Wathb focus** | ❌ | **Selection engine has no section concept at all** — it weights across all labels under the student's track regardless of section. This is a core behavior gap, not cosmetic. |
| STU-009 server-persisted per-question answers, idle-window partial close | ✅ | Answers persist per-question (`WathbService.answer()`) ✅; `POST /admin/wathb/close-idle` (admin-triggered, same manual-trigger pattern as plan_day/send_notification) closes any `opened` Wathb as `partial` — the enum value existed in the schema but was never assigned anywhere — once idle 30+ minutes, computed from the later of `openedAt` or the most recent answer so a Wathb the student is actively working through is never closed out from under them. Unanswered questions are left with no Answer row at all rather than force-scored, so "only answered questions count" falls out naturally of the existing report queries. |
| STU-010/011 review screen w/ cohort comparison | ✅ | Explanations screen ✅; cohort time/accuracy comparison now wired in — `WathbService.complete()` looks up `QuestionStats` per served question version and attaches `cohortMeanTimeMs`/`cohortAccuracy` (same `MIN_SAMPLE_FOR_REPORTING` gate as every other cohort figure in this app — null, not a misleading number, below threshold), rendered under each explanation as "وقتك Xث مقابل متوسط الطلاب Yث" / "دقة الطلاب لهذا السؤال: Z%". |
| STU-012 👍/👎 + problem report | ✅ | Review screen (`Explanations.jsx`) gets a one-tap 👍/👎 per explanation (`Answer.explanationRating`) and a "report a problem" note field, both keyed off the specific served `answerId` (not just the question — a question can recur across sessions). Reports land in a new `ProblemReport` model (open/resolved workflow, not just an audit-log event) and a new admin "بلاغات المشاكل" inbox with the student's name, note, and the exact answer attached, plus a resolve action. |
| STU-013 completion summary + per-label delta | ✅ | Built this session (`Complete.jsx`) |
| STU-020/021/022 dashboard, charts, MIN_SAMPLE gate | ✅ | `Performance.jsx`, `MIN_SAMPLE_FOR_REPORTING = 20` |
| STU-023 rule-based coaching advice | ✅ | `AdviceRule` (2-row demo per README) |
| STU-024/025 subscription mgmt, test activation | 🟡 | Subscription mgmt ✅; "activate tests" doesn't apply (single-test architecture) |
| STU-026/027 supervisor invite/revoke, invite-unregistered-number | 🟡 | Invite/revoke ✅; inviting an unregistered number **creates the account directly** rather than sending an invitation WhatsApp message that completes signup — different flow than spec's ONB-027 |
| STU-028 notification settings | ✅ | Daily window ✅ (built this session); weekly day/hour on supervisor side, not student side |
| STU-029 step-up OTP for sensitive actions | ❌ | Not built |
| STU-030 friendly expired/paused states | ✅ | Pricing screen's blocked-message covers subscription expiry/pause; a new dedicated `LinkExpired` screen (student and supervisor apps) now covers a magic-link exchange that comes back 401 (expired/used/revoked), with a "log in with a verification code" CTA that grants the same access a fresh link would |

## §3.4 Supervisor console (SUP)

| Req | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| SUP-001/002 read-only, shared parent/tutor console | ✅ | |
| SUP-003 card vs. table by count, needs-attention ordering | ✅ | `Dashboard.jsx` (`family_card` / `instructor_table`) |
| SUP-004/005 shared report, MIN_SAMPLE | ✅ | Enhanced this session with label/speed detail |
| SUP-006 notification prefs | ✅ | |
| SUP-007 accept/reject pending invite | ✅ | `GET /supervisors/me/invites` (browsable list, not just the magic link), `POST .../accept`, `POST .../reject`. `revokedAt` set without ever having `acceptedAt` reads as "rejected" — no new status column. Both endpoints now mutually guard against contradictory state (a rejected invite can't later be accepted, and vice versa) after live testing surfaced that the initial version let `acceptInvite` succeed on an already-rejected invite, producing a row with both `acceptedAt` and `revokedAt` set. `PendingInvites.jsx` + nav badge in the supervisor app. |
| SUP-008 supervisor pays on behalf of student | ❌ | Not built — checkout is student-session-only |

## §3.5–3.14 Admin console (ADM)

| Req | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| ADM-001/002 overview + alerts | ❌ | No overview screen at all in the current admin app (nav starts at taxonomy) |
| ADM-003 grouped nav | 🟡 | Flat nav list, ungrouped |
| ADM-010/011 taxonomy tree | ✅ | |
| ADM-012 **per-test language setting** | 🟡 | `Test.language` (`ContentLanguage` enum, ar/en, defaults `ar` for existing tests) chosen at creation, immutable afterward (`updateTest` strips it from the update payload — "chosen at creation" per spec). Wired into `WathbService.today()`/`complete()` as `contentLanguage`, which the student app uses to set `dir` on the question stem/options/explanation specifically — the app chrome stays Arabic RTL regardless (spec: "RTL is the default layout direction, not a theme"). Not yet done: no enforcement that a test's taxonomy/question content actually matches its declared language (nothing stops authoring English stems under an `ar` test), and the admin/supervisor apps don't yet flip content direction the same way the student app does. |
| ADM-013 composite weight, drag-reorder, soft-delete | 🟡 | `sort` field exists, no drag UI; retire exists for labels/questions |
| ADM-020–023 question bank + editor | ✅ | |
| ADM-024 versioning | ✅ | |
| ADM-025 duplicate detection | ✅ | `findSimilar` (pg_trgm) |
| ADM-026 bank-health widget | 🟡 | Correcting a stale ❌ in this doc — `bankHealthScore` + low-inventory label list were already built into the overview/alerts screen (`MIN_PUBLISHED_PER_LABEL = 10`); still a simplified stand-in for the spec's fuller "months-of-runway" demand-curve model, which this codebase has no per-day-plan data to compute |
| ADM-027 review queue | ✅ | `GET /admin/questions/review-queue` (FIFO, oldest first), `POST .../approve` and `.../reject` — reject requires a comment (spec: "approve/reject with a comment"), stored via the audit log rather than a new column. Reject returns the question to `draft` so its author can revise and resubmit; approve publishes it. Both are guarded to only fire on `in_review` questions. New "قائمة المراجعة" admin tab shows stem/options/label with an inline comment box per item. `QuestionEditor` gained a "إرسال للمراجعة" (submit for review) action on drafts, closing the loop — previously `in_review` was reachable only as a dead-end filter with no way to enter or leave it from the UI. |
| ADM-030/031 **destination-first import** | ❌ | Current import still requires a `label_id` column per row in the uploaded file — opposite of the spec's destination-selected-in-wizard model |
| ADM-032–034 template, 3-stage import, no partial commit | ✅ | Matches current (label-per-row) design |
| ADM-040–044 solution performance | ✅ | p-value/discrimination/flags ✅; explanation 👍/👎 counts ✅ (STU-012, this pass) via `QuestionStats.explanationUpvotes/Downvotes`; problem reports get their own dedicated inbox screen instead of an inline count. Still missing: distractor-distribution UI, correct-rate-over-time chart, per-student answer list |
| ADM-050/051 students list + detail report | ✅ | List ✅ with school/city filter and name/subscription-end/performance sort (also correcting a stale note in this doc claiming those filters/sort were still missing — they were already built). Detail: clicking a name opens `StudentDetail.jsx`, which now embeds a shared-report summary (lifetime/unique/weekly totals, streak, per-area accuracy, recent-mistake count) via the same `GET /report/student/:id` the supervisor app calls — not a link-out — alongside the ADM-052 history panels below it. |
| ADM-052 subscription/payment/delivery/access history on student detail | ✅ | `GET /admin/students/:id/detail` returns subscription/payment history (`Subscription` rows, which double as the payment record via `paymentRef`+`priceSnapshotHalalas` — no separate Payment model exists), the per-student notification-delivery log, session-by-session raw answers (`Wathb`+`Answer`), and a device/link access log (`MagicLink`+`MagicLinkAccess`, including IP/user-agent per access). Rendered as four sections on the new student detail screen. |
| ADM-060–066 geography & cohort | 🟡 | Region/city/school CRUD ✅, cohort report ✅ (this session); **no comparison-overlay view**, no city/region edit/delete/alias, no school merge tooling |
| ADM-070–076 subscriptions/packages/invoicing | 🟡 | List/CRUD/manual-activation ✅; **no invoicing at all** (no PDF, no ZATCA switch), no price-snapshot-on-subscribe verification, no discount codes, no auto-renew/proration |
| FRE-001–008 **free tier** | ❌ | **Entirely missing.** No package feature flags, no 1-Wathb/day cap, no partial-report blur, no locked-invite state |
| ADM-080/081 notification log | ✅ | |
| ADM-082 manual individual send w/ fresh link | ✅ | `send/:studentId` |
| ADM-083 bulk/promotional send to filtered audience | ✅ | `POST /admin/notifications/campaign/preview` (recipient count + sample, no dispatch) and `.../campaign/send`, filterable by package, subscription status, region/city/school, and inactivity (days since last completed Wathb). Respects opt-out, the same 2/day frequency cap as the automated job, and — found and fixed during live testing — a same-day repeat campaign to an already-messaged student now degrades to a counted skip instead of a 500 (the `(userId, kind, scheduledFor)` unique index that guards the daily job's own idempotency was also silently colliding on the second campaign send). Records cost estimate + full result breakdown in the audit log. New "إرسال جماعي لجمهور مُصفّى" panel on the notifications admin screen. |
| ADM-084 WABA quality/cost dashboard | ❌ | Not built |
| ADM-085 suspend + audit log | ❌ | Not built — no `audit_log` table, no suspend action anywhere |

## §3.15 Selection engine (SEL)

| Req | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| SEL-001 **one section per Wathb, rotating** | ❌ | Biggest functional gap — engine currently has no section-level concept |
| SEL-002/003 weighted scoring, hard constraints | ✅ | Weakness/coverage/recency/strength/exploration/variety/difficulty-ladder all implemented — just not scoped to a section |
| SEL-004 in-bundle no-repeat + 21-day spaced review | ✅ | No-repeat holds; 21-day review re-entry now implemented — `WathbGenerationService.pickQuestion` excludes correctly-answered questions permanently and wrong-answered ones only until 21 days have passed, `WathbService.answer()` sets `Answer.isReview` off a prior-answer check, and the student report's `totals.uniqueQuestionsAnswered` (distinct `questionId`) keeps the yearly unique-question tally honest independent of review repeats |
| SEL-005 passages atomic, own bundle | ✅ | `bundleType: 'passage'` exists in schema; verify generation logic honors it |
| SEL-006 graceful degradation + admin alert on exhaustion | 🟡 | Degradation = skip-and-continue (a bundle just serves fewer questions rather than erroring); **correcting an earlier overclaim in this doc** — no sibling-label borrowing actually exists. Admin alert now built: every exhaustion event is written to `AuditLog` (`selection.bank_exhausted`) and surfaced on the new admin overview screen's alerts feed (ADM-002), grouped by label with a count over the last 7 days |
| SEL-007 cold-start uniform coverage | ✅ | Placement Wathb |
| SEL-008 package/activated-test scoping | 🟡 | Package test scope ✅; "activated tests" plural doesn't apply (single-test model) |

## §3.16 Notification/magic-link engine (NOT)

| Req | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| NOT-001/002/003 scoped, hashed, high-entropy | ✅ | |
| NOT-004 **24-hour link validity** | ❌ | Current TTLs are purpose-specific and **not** 24h: `wathb`=6h, `weekly_report`/`link_invite`=7 days, `renewal`=1h. Contradicts NOT-004 directly — worth a deliberate decision, not silently "fixed" to 24h, since the 6h Wathb TTL was itself a documented choice (end-of-slot + grace). Flagging for explicit confirmation. |
| NOT-005 revoke on suspend/expiry/mobile-change, step-up | 🟡 | Revoke-on-suspend ✅ (ADM-085), revoke-on-expiry ✅ (`CheckoutService.sweepExpiredSubscriptions`, admin-triggered like plan_day); revoke-on-mobile-change and step-up (STU-029) don't apply yet — neither a mobile-change nor a step-up-gated action exists in the product at all |
| NOT-006/007 utility template, reactive scheduler | ✅ | `reactive-scheduler.ts`, tested |
| NOT-008 idempotent nightly plan, UTC storage | ✅ | `plan_day` idempotent per `(student, date)`; admin-triggered not cron |
| NOT-009 paused/expired/suspended/skip/quiet-hour handling, retry ladder | ✅ | Skip-days ✅, quiet-hours ✅ (slot start/end). Suspended-user and already-completed-Wathb states now skip the send with `NotificationStatus.skipped` (a neutral outcome, not logged as a delivery failure) — correcting this doc's stale claim that "suspended state doesn't exist" (ADM-085 added it earlier in this session; the notification path just never checked it). Retry ladder: 15m/1h/4h backoff (`Notification.retryCount`/`nextRetryAt`), `POST /admin/notifications/process-retries` (admin-triggered, same manual pattern as the other jobs), and a `GET /admin/notifications/undelivered` list of numbers that exhausted the ladder, surfaced on the delivery-log admin screen. Verified live: suspended-skip, already-completed-skip, a due retry recovering to `sent`, and an exhausted-ladder row appearing in the undelivered list while being correctly excluded from further retry attempts. |
| NOT-010 frequency caps, STOP opt-out | 🟡 | 2/day cap ✅ (`MAX_STUDENT_MESSAGES_PER_DAY`); **no STOP/إيقاف keyword handling at all** |
| NOT-011 admin manual + bulk send | ✅ | Manual ✅ (`send/:studentId`); bulk/filtered-campaign ✅ (ADM-083, this pass) — both share the same opt-out check and frequency cap as automated sends |
| NOT-012 channel abstraction | ✅ | `NotificationChannel` interface, Console/WhatsApp adapters |

## §4 Data model

Present: `User/Student/Supervisor/StudentSupervisor`, `Region/City/School` (no `SchoolEnrollment` history table — student↔school is a single current pointer, not a history), `Test/Section/Area/Label/Passage/Question/QuestionVersion`, `Package/Subscription` (no `Invoice`, no `DiscountCode`), `Wathb/Answer` (no section-focus field on `Wathb`, no snapshotted school/city/region on `Answer`), `MagicLink/MagicLinkAccess`, `Notification/WaSession`, `student_label_stats` (✅ materialized, matches spec exactly), `question_stats` (✅ built this session), `cohort_label_stats` — **documented deviation**: computed live, not materialized nightly. **Missing entirely**: `Invoice`, `DiscountCode`/`Redemption`, `audit_log`, `SchoolEnrollment`. No package feature-flag columns for the free tier.

## §6 Non-functional requirements

| Req | Status |
|---|---|
| NFR-001 payload/perf budget | 🟡 Not measured/enforced, likely fine at current bundle size |
| NFR-002 report from materialized stats | ✅ |
| NFR-003/003a RTL, responsive | ✅ (this session's shell rebuild) |
| NFR-004/005 magic link security, rate limiting | ✅ Security properties ✅; rate limiting now in place on every auth entry point (`@nestjs/throttler`, 5 req/5min on admin login, OTP request, signup; 10/5min on OTP verify; 20/5min on magic-link exchange) |
| NFR-005a OTP fallback prod-safety | ❌ No audit log entry, no deploy-time check |
| NFR-006/006a cohort 403, free-tier server enforcement | 🟡 Cohort 403 ✅; free-tier N/A (doesn't exist) |
| NFR-007 anti-sharing signal | ❌ Not built |
| NFR-008 PDPL (consent, export/delete, retention) | ❌ Not built |
| NFR-009 VAT invoicing | ❌ Not built |
| NFR-010 Meta policy compliance (categories, opt-out) | 🟡 Categories used correctly; opt-out missing |
| NFR-011/012/013 statistical honesty, server timing, plain-language metrics | ✅ / ✅ / 🟡 (plain-language wording from §1.3.1 not literally used in admin UI copy yet) |
| NFR-014 accessibility | ❌ Not addressed |
| NFR-015/016 idempotent sends, UTC storage | ✅ |

## §9 Open product questions — adopting the SRS's own recommendations as defaults

The SRS states these "materially change the implementation" and lists a recommendation for most. Rather than guess silently or block on all 14, adopting the stated recommendation, documented here, so it's a visible decision point you can override at any time:

1. **Auto-renew vs. manual** → manual (no recommendation given; safer default, matches what's built — a subscription just expires, no stored payment method to auto-charge yet).
2. **Who pays** → student-primary flow stays as built; SUP-008 (supervisor pays) is a real gap, not resolved by this default.
3. **Missed-day behavior** → **vanish** (SRS recommendation) — already the de facto behavior (no rollover/stacking exists).
4. **On-demand extra practice, paid tiers** → allow, uncapped for now (matches current "another Wathb" button); revisit once the free tier exists and caps matter.
5. **Skip/back** → **neither** (SRS recommendation) — already the built behavior.
6. **Passage bundles** → **own Wathb** (SRS recommendation) — matches `bundleType: 'passage'`.
7. **Headline composite score** → **neutral internal index, not a predicted score** (SRS recommendation) — informs how I'll build STU-001's missing composite index: a 0–100 index, never framed as "your estimated Qiyas score."
8. **Content origin** → out of scope for engineering; no action.
9. **Minimum volume before question stats shown to admins** → already implemented as `MIN_SAMPLE_FOR_REPORTING = 20` for p-value, 20 distinct students for discrimination (Phase 6, this session).
10. **Data residency** → infrastructure/hosting decision, not code; no action.
11. **School registry source** → organic (student-suggested + admin review), already built.
12. **PDPL justification for school data** → **optional + skippable + honest purpose** (SRS recommendation) — already how `Student.schoolId` is modeled (nullable, opt-in).
13. **Free-tier shape specifics** (duration, blur portion, prompt wording) → no recommendation given; needs a real answer before FRE-001–008 can be built correctly. **Flagging this one specifically as worth a real decision**, not a default — the blur boundary is a product/legal call (FRE-004 requires it enforced server-side), not something to guess at.
14. **B2B roadmap** → no action needed now; SRS itself says decide direction, build later.

## Recommended build order

Given the scale, roughly in priority order by (spec importance × how self-contained the change is):

1. **SEL-001 single-section-per-Wathb** — the single biggest behavioral gap; changes the selection engine's core loop.
2. **Composite index** (STU-001/SUP-003/ADM-*) — referenced throughout the UI spec as a headline number; currently doesn't exist anywhere.
3. **NOT-004 24h magic links + NOT-010 STOP opt-out** — security/compliance-adjacent, self-contained.
4. **Free tier (FRE-001–008)** — big, but well-specified; blocked on open question #13 (blur boundary) for full fidelity — will build the mechanism with a placeholder boundary and flag it clearly.
5. **ADM-030/031 destination-first import redesign**.
6. **ADM-085 suspend + audit log** — touches many actions (wire-transfer activation, OTP fallback use, manual sends) that should already be writing to it.
7. **ADM-001/002 admin overview + alerts** — currently the admin app has no landing screen.
8. Everything else in this document, roughly by section order.

Invoicing/ZATCA (ADM-074), discount codes (ADM-076), WABA dashboard (ADM-084), and PDPL export/delete (NFR-008) are large, mostly-standalone subsystems better scoped as their own follow-up passes rather than folded into this one.
